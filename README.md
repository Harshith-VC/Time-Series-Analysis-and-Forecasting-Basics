# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-Basics

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting** using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a practical guide for working with time-ordered data and predicting future values.

## Key Highlights of the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze time series data to identify patterns like trends, seasonality, and noise.
   - Visualizations to better understand the data's structure and behavior.

2. **Time Series Decomposition:**
   - Decomposing the data into trend, seasonal, and residual components to understand the underlying structure.

3. **Forecasting Models:**
   - **ARIMA and SARIMA:** Classical models for time series forecasting.
   - **Exponential Smoothing Techniques:** Simple and Holt-Winters methods for smoothing the data and predicting future values.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess forecast accuracy.

5. **Real-world Application:**
   - The project uses a sample dataset (or user-provided data) to demonstrate the complete workflow, including training and testing models, and making future predictions.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Graphs and charts to show trends, model fits, and forecasted values, aiding interpretation and decision-making.

## Purpose

The project is designed to provide a practical understanding of how time series analysis and forecasting can be applied in various fields such as:

- Sales prediction
- Demand forecasting
- Stock price analysis
- Weather prediction
